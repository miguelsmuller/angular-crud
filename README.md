## üí• **Overview**
This project is a study system in **[Angular](https://angular.io/)** and implementing using the best practices of reactive programming.

It comes initially with a authentication using **[FireBase Service](https://firebase.google.com/)** and some more important points that are mentioned below. Has architecture was designed to be easy to understand and without use of any palliative programming - Go Horse.

- Use **Material Design** with adequate customization.
- Component interaction with **@Input()** and **@Output()**
- Managing global and local state with **NgRx**
- Use of **implementation classes** and **dependency injection**
- Find and fix problems in TS with **ESlint**
- Code formatter with **Prettier**
- Git Automation with **Husky** - Using **commitlint** and **commitizer**

## üèÅ **Project Requirements**  
Make sure that you also have **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)** and **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)** installed on your computer.
- `$ node --version` and `$ npm --version`

<br/>

**Install dependencies** of project with:  
- `$ npm install`

<br/>

**Angular Cli** is already part of the development dependencies, so any cli functionality can be used with the prefix npx.

- `$ npx ng serve`

<br/>

**First Execution - Environment files**: In the first execution of the project, it is **essential** to create the environment files (_environment.ts_) in _/src/environments_ according to the model that follows inside the folder (_environment.exp.ts_).

<br/>
