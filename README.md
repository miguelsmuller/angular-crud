## üí• **Overview**
This project is a study system in **[Angular](https://angular.io/)** and implementing using the best practices of reactive programming.

It comes initially with a authentication using **[FireBase Service](https://firebase.google.com/)** and some more important points that are mentioned below. Has architecture was designed to be easy to understand and without use of any palliative programming - Go Horse.

#### **Features**:
- Use **Material Design** with adequate customization.
- Component interaction with **@Input()** and **@Output()**
- Managing global and local state with **NgRx**
- Use of **implementation classes** and **dependency injection**
- Find and fix problems in TS with **ESlint**
- Code formatter with **Prettier**
- Git Automation with **Husky** - Using **commitlint** and **commitizer**

  
## üèÅ **Project Requirements**  
Make sure that you also have **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)** and **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)** installed on your computer.
- `$ node --version` and `$ npm --version`

Also make sure you have **Angular CLI** and **Firebase CLI** installed globally on your machine.  
- `$ npm install -g @angular/cli firebase-tools`

- `$ npm install`

#### üìå **First run - Environment files**  
In the first execution of the project, it is **essential** to create the environment files (`environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`) in _**/src/environments**_ according to the model that follows inside the folder (`environment.example.ts`).

## üìÇ **Project Structure**

#### ü©∫ **About Tests**  
To run the tests properly with the windows environment using wsl2 some adjustments were necessary. 

With the help of [Yoshi.T#1769](https://github.com/y16i) in discord the integration of karma using wsl2 has been established. After installing the chrome according to the link below, the karma was configured according to this commit and the export was done as follows:
- `export CHROME_BIN='/usr/bin/google-chrome'`
